                            As a child, Glen Rudge enjoyed his adventures as a Cub Scout where he explored the
                            beautiful landscape of
                            California. Later, he joined the Sea Scouts where he learned
                            navigation and the rules and regulations of boating which was a passion for him. Often
                            sailing, motoring, or
                            building rafts which he maneuvered around the waterways of Alameda. He has lived a life
                            rich with experience he
                            shares with almost everyone he meets.

                            The art of giving? It is still alive and radiates in Glenâ€™s writing. Each book answers
                            different questions
                            and poses alternative ideas and feelings for the reader. He hopes you find them
                            enlightening and enjoyable.
                            Who knows, perhaps his work can expand your horizons while making you laugh and/or cry or
                            just say OH MY GOD! How'd he come up with that. Either way he writes for you... ENJOY!
