                <h2>About Glen</h2>
                <p>Glen's is a poet, a writer and a dreamer. Using his creative mind, he tranfsorms words
                    into a temporary environment you feel a part of.
                    Glen has a way of channeling his thoughts and captivating his readers. He has some of the most
                    beautiful
                    and
                    thought provoking poems ever written. A myriad of different styles and many different themes...
                    Glen writes a great mix of poetry and creates lovely images in my heart and mind....Really great to
                    have
                    around when
                    one feels like looking at some of the important things in life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a child, Glen Rudge enjoyed his adventures as a Cub Scout where he explored the
                    beautiful landscape of
                    California. Later, he joined the Sea Scouts where he learned
                    navigation and the rules and regulations of boating which was a passion for him. Often
                    sailing, motoring, or
                    building rafts which he maneuvered around the waterways of Alameda. He has lived a life
                    rich with experience he
                    shares with almost everyone he meets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The art of giving? It is still alive and radiates in Glenâ€™s writing. Each book answers
                    different questions
                    and poses alternative ideas and feelings for the reader. He hopes you find them
                    enlightening and enjoyable.
                    Who knows, perhaps his work can expand your horizons while making you laugh and/or cry or
                    just say OH MY GOD! How'd he come up with that. Either way he writes for you... ENJOY!
