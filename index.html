            As you travel through life, you'll see many books. Maybe the cover of one strikes you, and you pick it
            up, and look. Some books take you far away, some will bring you back home. These books will make you
            say, wow, I like that poem. Each of these books are different, in their own special way. With one or
            two being addicting, making you see things all day. Surprise, surprise, yes I wrote them for you, and
            each poem and art-piece, set right here for you. As to what each-one means? You'll have to decide on
            your own. Pick one or two of them up, and take them on home. Enjoy the day reading, take in each secret
            clue, savor it slowly, I wrote it for you. Take a leap into the author's skin, it's my professional
            opinion, you'll want to read them again. I'm not here just talking, I've experienced, and I know, step
            in for the journey and away you go. Each and every page lives, each and every page breathes,
            come back soon to my site here, savory leaves...Page by page, I guess I don't need to say, what will
            you do? For your mind today...Enjoy.
