                        As you travel through life, you'll see many books. Maybe the cover of one strikes you, and you
                        pick it
                        up, and look. Some books take you far away, some will bring you back home. These books will
                        make you
                        say, wow, I like that poem. Each of these books are different, in their own special way. With
                        one or
                        two being addicting, making you see things all day. Surprise, surprise, yes I wrote them for
                        you, and
                        each poem and art-piece, set right here for you. As to what each-one means? You'll have to
                        decide on
                        your own. Pick one or two of them up, and take them on home. Enjoy the day reading, take in
                        each secret
                        clue, savor it slowly, I wrote it for you. Take a leap into the author's skin, it's my
                        professional
                        opinion, you'll want to read them again. I'm not here just talking, I've experienced, and I
                        know, step
                        in for the journey and away you go. Each and every page lives, each and every page breathes,
                        come back soon to my site here, savory leaves...Page by page, I guess I don't need to say, what
                        will
